Reimplementation of the SIGGRAPH paper "FlowRep: Descriptive Curve Networks for Free-Form Design Shapes". This implementation is incomplete, however it could serve as a starting point for anyone trying to reimplement this paper.

# Contents of the reimplementation

 - [x] Implement quad-dominant mesh input reading.
 - [x] Create a graph with edges as nodes and determine the graph weights.
 - [x] Implement the Correlation clustering to obtrain the initial strands.
 - [x] Extract the initial flowlines.
 - [x] Transform the flowlines in a graph structure.
 - [x] Perform the correlation clustering with the initial flowlines.
 - [x] Extract reliable flowlines.
 - [x] Use "Ridge and Valley detection".
 - [ ] Segment image with result.
 - [ ] Create and simplify the network.
 - [ ] Optimize the network.
